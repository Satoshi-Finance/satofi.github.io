# Overview

[Satoshi Finance](https://www.satofi.app) is a decentralized stable coin protocol that allows user to mint a USD-pegged token called btUSD by using [BTCB](https://www.binance.com/en/collateral-btokens) as collateral on BNB Smart Chain. 

The minimum allowed collateral value ratio to minted btUSD is 110%: for example, you could mint 1000 btUSD by collateralizing $1100 worth of BTCB.

There are also some battle-tested mechanisms in place for the stability of btUSD. Learn more about how these mechanisms work in dedicated documentation sections.

## Key Features in summary
-  Interest-Free: There is no interest for the minted btUSD no matter you are going to keep the collateralized position for a month or a year
-  Efficient-Liquidation: btUSD holders could deposit into stability pool to provide offset reserve for liquidation and earn liquidated collateral plus SATO token in return
-  Guaranteed-Low-Bound: When btUSD is traded below $1 peg, any btUSD holder could redeem 1 btUSD for $1 worth of collateral from the system, thus making an effective support for restoring the peg
-  Immutable: All protocol parameters are determined at time of contracts deployment and no admin or DAO could change the values or upgrade the contracts 
-  Decentralization-First: Everyone could host a frontend User Interface to diversify the adoption and provide censorship resistance
