# SATO Staking

## How does staking work in Satoshi Finance? 
Simply stake your SATO token to the dedicated staking contract. 

Every staker will earn a proportional share of all protcol fee:

- mint fee in btUSD
- redemption fee in collateral
- flashloan fee in collateral

## What is premium staking?
You could choose to stake 1024 SATO tokens permanently to access premium privileges within the system:

- less mint fee floor of `0.4%` compared to usual `0.5%`
- less redemption fee floor of `0.4%` compared to usual `0.5%`
- more collateral surplus if liquidated in Recovery Mode

Note the permanently staked SATO for premium will continue earning a share of the fees.

## Is there a lock-up period?
No, you can withdraw your staked SATO plus fee earnings at any time. 

But note the 1024 SATO token used for premium staking is permanently locked, e.g., cant be withdrawn.

## Can I stake btUSD? 
You can only stake SATO tokens. btUSD can be deposited into the Stability Pool for SATO rewards.
